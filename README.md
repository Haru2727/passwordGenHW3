    This weeks task required us to create an application using JavaScript that can allow employees create new random passwords based of selected criteria.  Being supplied with the HTML and CSS code our focus was on creating working JavaScript to make the application actually work.  The task asked us to allow the user to select if they wanted lower/upper case letters, numbers, and special characters in thier new random password.  When the user selected the criteria they would be given a new random password generated by my added JavaScript code.

  I had a difficult time getting this started but once I learned how to complete step one the other steps became clearer for me as to why to add them.  I learned how the fromCharCode works with obtaining characters without having to put them in a const array.   I struggled to get code to show up in the text box at first and continue to struggle to have it come out at the correct length.  I understand the reasoning behind for loops
